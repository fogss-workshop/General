## About FOGSS

FOGSS workshops are the forum where the community maps out actionable priorities for Greenland Ice Sheet Science that inform U.S. funding agency programmatic planning.
Our vision is to have FOGSS serves as a mechanism by which interested community members can openly self-organize into groups that initiate and carry out prioritized work.
